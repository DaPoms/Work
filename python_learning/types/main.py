myInt = 5
myDouble = 1.5
myString = "apple"
#note that there is no type "char"
print(myInt, myDouble, myString) #automatically spaces outputs
#print(myInt + " " + myDouble) This would not work as typing between #'s and strings is not allowed
print(myInt, " ", myDouble) #this is the solution to the above problem (but only if you need more than 1 space, as ","'s already add one space)
