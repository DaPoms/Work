        <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "styling.css" type = "text/css" /> <!--Note that the attribute "src" entails embedding the document whereas "href" entails referencing it-->
        <!--BEcause of haven't gotten to learning JS yet, here is an example link to note something I learned:
        <script src = "myJS.js" defer></script>
        the defer attribute is recommended, as it waits to run the JS until all the HTML is loaded, preventing errors. Note that defer is a boolean attribute, its presence enables it (NO need to do something like defer = "true")
        Note that <script> is not a void element / self closing tag, mianly as you ca write direct JS in the field between the script tags.
