        Here is some code. I wrote this in the &ltpre&gt tag as it preserves formatting!: <!-- notice the use of &lt and &gt for the < and > signs-->
            public class Main
            {
                public static void main(String[] args)
                {
                    System.out.println("Hello world!");
                }
            }

        <audio controls src = ./cheer.mp3> </audio> <!--controls allows the audio box to start/stop the audio on the webpage. Autoplay would allows it to play automatically on load-->
