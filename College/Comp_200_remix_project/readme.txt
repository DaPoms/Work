My composition and literature course lets us do whatever we want for the final project so long as it is based off of the essay we wrote about a memoir we read. I read the glass castle by
Jeanette walls, and my essay was about how societal pressures made Rex the abusive father he was. This game is to show how people are forced into conforming to societal pressures
and how that can be deterimental to you.
